\section{Transfer to linear categories}
\label{Transferv2}

In this section we shall define a symmetric monoidal functor from the bicategory of iterated correspondences of (locally finite) groupoids to the bicategory of linear categories. The functor we write is a slight generalization of the {\em $2$-linearization} functor of Morton **CITE**, in that we extend the domain of definition from finite groupoids to locally finite groupoids.

The source of the functor is the symmetric monoidal bicategory of iterated correspondences of locally finite groupoids, $\Corr_2^\times$. The objects of this bicategory are the locally finite groupoids. A $1$-morphism from an object $\GG$ to an object $\GG'$ is a correspondence, that is, a diagram 
\begin{equation*}
    \stik{1}{ 
    \& \HH \ar[rd] \ar[ld] \& \\
    \GG \& \& \GG',}
\end{equation*}
wherein both functors are finite. Finally, a $2$-morphism is an equivalence class of correspondences of correspondences, that is, an equivalence class of diagrams
\begin{equation*}
    \stik{1}{ \& \& \HH \ar{rrd} \ar{lld} \ar[Rightarrow, shorten <=1em,shorten >=2em]{ldd} \ar[Rightarrow, shorten <=1em,shorten >=2em]{rdd} \& \& \\
    \GG \& \& \mathcal{I} \ar{u} \ar{d}    \& \& \GG'.\\
     \& \ \& \HH' \ar{rru} \ar{llu} \& \ \& } %This sucks
\end{equation*}
wherein all functors are finite. Two such diagrams are equivalent when ***BLAH BLAH*** **CITE MORTON**.

\begin{Remark}
Locally finite groupoids and finite functors between them form an $\infty$-category $\Spaces$ having finite limits. In **CITE** Haugseng defines a symmetric monoidal $(\infty,2)$-category of iterated correspondences in $\CCC$ for any $\infty$-category $\CCC$ having finite limits. The symmetric monoidal bicategory $\Corr_2^\times$ is the homotopy bicategory of Haugseng's $(\infty,2)$-category of iterated correspondences in $\Spaces$.
